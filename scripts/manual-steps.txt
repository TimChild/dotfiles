Final instructions to initialize everything:

nvim:
run :Copilot -- then follow instructions to enable

tmux:
possibly need to do <prefix> + I to install plugins

Restart the system for all changes to take effect (e.g. default terminal, font, etc.)

Remember to use `Alacritty` as the terminal emulator. (should already be set as default -- possibly need to run `sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator` and select it)
