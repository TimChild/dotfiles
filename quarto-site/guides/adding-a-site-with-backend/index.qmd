## Overview

This guide covers adding a site that also runs a backend service to the webserver. It assumes you have set up the webserver following the [webserver setup guide](../setting-up-webserver/index.qmd).

The process is very similar to that of [adding a static site](../adding-a-static-site/index.qmd), but with a few additional steps to set up the backend service.

## Adding a site with a backend service

I'll give the example of a [Reflex](https://reflex.dev) site. This is a pure python framework that facilitates creating performant Next.js websites with a python backend and websocket communication.

### Initializing a new site

TODO: 
- create a task for creating a reflex site (also needs to add a service to the docker-compose file).
